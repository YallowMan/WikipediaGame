The program can fairly quickly find a connection between two pages compared to the original version of the algorithm, but at first glance may not seem like its all too better. It can find pages that are close to each other in incredibly
fast times, but tends to have many discovered pages in return. All in all, it was a different kind of experience when it came to working on this algorithm especially when working with Aider.
